Amazon ElastiC Block Storage (EBS)

EBS Magnetic
EBS General Purpose
Provisioned IOPS

EBS Use Cases

Operating System
Databases
Enterprise Applications
Business Continuity
Applications

Amazon EC2 Instance Storage

Local
Availability
Storage optimized instanes
No persistence
All data is automatically deleted when an EC2 instace stops, fails or is terminated

Amazon VPC or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

VPC infrastructure
Public Subnet
Private Subnet
Web server
NAT server
Security Groups
Avialability Zone

is it posible to have an entire infrastructure in a vpc network with x amount of computers in the network ?




##################### Security , Identity and Access Management ########################################






NVP Infrastructure
What is an enpoint in AWS infrastructure ?
:VPC Endpoint. A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services 
powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway,NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.



SSL/TLS Endpoinst: API endpoint to stablish secure communication sessions
Security Groups : Instance firewalls
VPC: Network control


AWS Multi-Tier Security Groups
Web tier port 80 and 443 are open for web access
Application tier
Database tier
All other internet ports blocked by default


VPC: apply NAT and VPN support to your instances






AWS Identity and Access Managment (IAM)

Manage AWS IAM users and their access
Manage AWS IAM roles and their permissions
Manage federated users and their permissions

AWS IAM Authorization

Authorization

Policies:

Policy element generator 
Policty elements simulator 

Are JSON documents to describe permissions
Are ssigned to Users, Groups or Roles


AWS IAM Best Practicse
    Delete AWS account(root) access keys
    Create individual IAM users
    Use Groups to assign permissions to IAM users
    Grant least privilege
    Configure a strong password policy
    Enable MFA for privileged users

AWS Resourse-Based Policies

Are an alternative to IAM and supported by some services,
Grant cross-account access to your resourcse
Use a principal to uniquely idenfity accoun tin the policy
Supported AWS services include

Amazon S3 Bucket Policy
Amazon SNS Topic Policy
Amazon SQS Queue        //
Amazon Glacier Vault    //
AWS OpsWorks Stack      //






#################### AWS Databases ##################################

RDS features: 
Cost-efficient and resizable capacity. Manages time-consuming database administration task, 
Access to the full capabilities of Amazon autora, MySql, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, 
Oracle, and PostgreSQL databases.


Amazon RDS Backups Work
Automatic Backups:-----------
Restore your database to a point in time
Are enabled by default
Let you choose a retention period up to 35 days
----------------------------------------------

Manual Snapshots
Let you bild a new database instance from a snapshot
Are initiated by the usersPersist until the user deletes them
Are stored in Amazon S3




RDS DB instances

DB instances are the basic building blocks of amaozn RDS.

They are an isolated database enviroment in the cloud.
They can contain multiple user-created databases





DB Parameter & Option Groups

Amazon RDS Best Practices

Monitor your memory , CPU, and storage usage.
Use Multi-AZ
Enable automatic backups
Set the backup window to oocur during the daily lwo in Write IOPS.


To increase the I/O capacity of DB instance
Migrate to DB instance class with I/O capacity
Convert from stardard storage to provisioned IOPS
Provision additional throghput capacity if using provisioned IOPS storage.
Set a TTL of less than 30 second inf your clien application is caching the DNS data of your DB instances



// Amazon DynamoDB == NOSQL database

is a NoSql database service
Store any amount of data with no limits
Fast, predictalbe performance using SSDs
Easily provision and change the request capacity needed for each table
Fully managed Nosql amazon service

In amazon DynamoDB a table is a collection of items, each item is a collection of attributes, each
attribute is a name-value pair and can contain a single value , a json document or a set of values.


DynamoDB provides tow kinds of primary keys
first is a Partition key: a simple primary key with a sinble one value
Second is a composive key:
